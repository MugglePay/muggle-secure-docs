# Muggle Escrow Services - The world's first decentralized escrow services  for crypto currencies

## Why choose escrow services?

Today's society is becoming increasingly complex, and the internet is filled with various traps, tricks, and pitfalls. We should always be wary and cautious, as the saying goes, "Beware of the person harboring evil intentions and never be without a guard against others." It's always better to be safe than sorry. Once we fall victim to fraud, we can only regret it. Although we can seek legal recourse to protect our rights, the cost of doing so is often prohibitively high, and we often end up compromising. Only through escrow services can we ensure the interests of effective buyers.

When shopping on platforms like eBay, we often encounter situations where the seller's enthusiasm wanes after we make the payment. Their responses to our inquiries become less timely. Of course, in such cases, we can apply for a refund directly through eBay. However, if the transaction was conducted privately without any remarks, it becomes more troublesome. We cannot go to court over a few hundred or thousand yuan. Sometimes, we don't even have the contact information of the seller, making it impossible to forcefully demand a refund. Even if we manage to contact the seller, if they refuse to refund, we are left helpless, and in the end, we suffer the loss ourselves. Therefore, it's best to always keep control and opt for using a third-party escrow services platform instead of direct transfers.

We all understand this reasoning, but many times we still fall victim to scams, not because we are unaware, but because we have no other options. Many scammers operate anonymously, and legal means often cannot resolve the issue. Only through institutional development can we make it difficult for criminals to conduct their wrongdoings.

## Why not use PayPal or Alipay for escrow services?

Many netizens may ask, "Isn't there Paypal or Aliapy for escrow transactions?" That's correct, but you may have noticed that Aliapy only provides escrow services for products under Alibaba's umbrella. When we conduct transfers using Paypal, it does not offer escrow services. In other words, Paypal only provides escrow services for platforms like eBay and Tmall. Not everyone has a eBay store, and Tmall stores are even more limited. Moreover, many of our needs are low-frequency, and the escrow transactions on eBay follow standardized procedures, with customer service only intervening when disputes arise. Many eBay rules do not apply, and blindly applying eBay's user agreement often puts either the seller or the buyer at a disadvantage.

Currently, Chinese escrow services market is dominated solely by Aliapy, which only provides escrow services for platforms under Alibaba. It is difficult for Paypal to guarantee our interests when we do business with foreigners online. As a result, many of our personalized escrow services needs cannot be met, giving scammers an opportunity. However, this situation is about to change!

## What is Muggle Guarantee?

Muggle Guarantee is the world's first third-party escrow services platform for digital currencies, dedicated to resolving the trust issues of whether to make payment or deliver goods first in online transactions.

<b>Mugglebao Escrow Trading Platform</b> is the first platform globally to offer escrow services for users' digital currencies.

- Muggle Guarantee provides personalized escrow services services tailored to users' needs. Everything is based on users' pre-agreed terms, guided by the spirit of contracts. Every person has their unique personalized escrow services requirements. For example, if I want to share a rental property and directly contact the seller through a forum, we may be very satisfied with the service and price. However, we can't agree on whether to make payment first or use the property first. Often, users find the seller has disappeared after making the payment. The low entry barrier in the industry leads to uneven participation by various institutions, resulting in a lack of protection. This problem is prevalent not only in traditional buying and selling transactions but also in many online services.

- Muggle Guarantee makes your digital currencies more secure. There are numerous cases of digital currency fraud in emails and WeChat. Even FCOIN has been categorized as fraudulent, yet the victims cannot recover their rights. Mugglebao has years of experience in the field of digital currencies, with millions of users covered each month, providing security for your digital assets.

- Protecting privacy online. By safeguarding the privacy of both buyers and sellers, trust is established in online transactions. Perhaps you can earn $10 by completing a task online, but you don't want to disclose your email or Paypal account associated with your phone number or reveal your PayPal email. What's more, the opposite party may run off after receiving the payment. This is where you should use Muggle Guarantee services.

Remember: If you directly transfer money online to a stranger, there is a 99% chance of a run-off risk!
